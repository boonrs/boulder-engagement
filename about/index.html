<h1>City Initiative to Reenergize and Broaden Community Engagement With the Help of Code for America</h1>

<p>In 2015, the City of Boulder is undertaking an initiative to develop new approaches and tools to support community engagement that is broadly inclusive, transparent and interactive in the <a href="http://housingboulder.net/">Housing Boulder</a> project.</p>

<p>To do this, the city is teaming with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> – a non-profit organization that specializes in reinventing the way residents collaborate and interact with government, and with each other – to encourage and empower residents to take an active role in their community and in addressing the challenges we face.</p>

<p>“We've been very impressed with Boulder's commitment to creating an inclusive and collaborative relationship with their community. We are excited to help support the city in this effort,” said <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/catherine-bracy/">Catherine Bracy</a>, Director of Community Organizing.</p>

<p>The seven month project begins in January 2015 and will be a supported by senior fellow <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/becky-boone/">Becky Boone</a>, who will reside in Boulder full time. Throughout the project, the City of Boulder, with support from Code for America, will create a variety of ways for community members, particularly the traditionally under-represented, to work cooperatively together to address important issues. Fellow Becky Boone will help with researching community needs, meeting with stakeholders, and, if needed, collaborating with the city to build technology in an iterative, user-centered, data-driven way.</p>

<p>“I’m excited by how passionate the Boulder community is. I look forward to collaborating with the community on a more inclusive conversation,” said Senior Fellow Becky Boone.</p>

<p>The city agreement with Code for America specifies a fixed fee of $100,000.  This is only a portion of the total $150,000 project cost; the remaining funds will be raised with help from the community.</p>

<p>This initiative will result in an ongoing platform (physical and virtual) for inclusive, transparent and interactive engagement – creating an approach that can be replicated on other projects and in other communities.</p>

<p>"The city takes transparency and community collaboration seriously," said City Manager Jane Brautigam. "Communication in the twenty-first century is changing and we want to harness the entrepreneurial spirit of our community and be part of that change."</p>

<p>In addition, the <a href="http://codeforboulder.org/">Code for Boulder Brigade</a> – a group of local volunteers – will participate in this community engagement project.  The involvement of these local experts who are excited about improving resident engagement in Boulder will be an integral part of the Code for America project.</p>

<p>Code for America is a national non-profit that believes government can work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. In collaboration with communities, companies, and government, Code for America builds open sources technology and organizes a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, Code for America has partnered with 30 cities and 105 fellows, supported the growth of 127 Brigade chapters with more than 4,500 volunteers, accelerated and incubated 21 civic tech companies, and developed a network of more than 250 government staff who collaborate and support one another.</p>
